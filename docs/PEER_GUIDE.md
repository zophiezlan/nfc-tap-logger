## 👋 Your Job

Help people tap their card at this station. That's it!

---

## 📋 The Workflow

### When someone arrives:

1. **Hand them a card** (if they don't have one)

   Say: *"Tap this at each station so we can track wait times"*

2. **Point to the tap zone** (where NFC reader is)

   Say: *"Tap here and wait for the beep"*

3. **They tap the card**

   ⏱️ Hold flat on reader for 1-2 seconds

4. **Listen for feedback:**

   | Sound | Meaning | What to say |
   |-------|---------|-------------|
   | 🔊 **BEEP** | ✅ Success! | "You're all set!" |
   | 🔊🔊 **BEEP-BEEP** | ⚠️ Already tapped here | "Already checked in - you're good!" |
   | 🔊━━━ **BEEEEEP** | ❌ Error | "Try tapping again, hold it flat" |

5. **Done!** They move on

## 🛠️ If Something Goes Wrong

### No beep when tapped:
1. ✅ Ask them to **try again** - hold flat for 2 seconds
2. ✅ Try a **different card**
3. ✅ If still fails: **Write it down manually** (name or number)
4. ✅ Come find Clancy if it keeps happening

### Station looks dead (no lights/sounds):
1. ✅ Check power bank is on
2. ✅ Come find Clancy

### Not sure what beep means:
- 1 short beep = **Good!**
- 2 short beeps = **Already did this, also good!**
- 1 long beep = **Didn't work, try again**

## 🚫 You Do NOT Need To:

- ❌ Troubleshoot the hardware
- ❌ Check logs or restart anything
- ❌ Worry if a few taps fail
- ❌ Enter data into a computer

**Your only job: help people tap → hear beep → move on**
