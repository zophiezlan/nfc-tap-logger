# On-Site Setup & Failover Guide

**Dead simple, highly reliable on-site operation with zero SSH required.**

## 🎯 Overview

The on-site setup system provides:

- ✅ **WiFi Auto-Connect**: Priority-based connection to known networks
- ✅ **Physical WiFi Setup Button**: Configure new networks without SSH
- ✅ **mDNS Discovery**: Access stations via `tapstation-queue.local` (no IP hunting!)
- ✅ **Automatic Failover**: One station handles both stages when peer fails
- ✅ **Status LED Indicators**: Visual feedback for WiFi/system state
- ✅ **Peer Health Monitoring**: Automatic detection of peer failures
- ✅ **Watchdog Service**: Auto-recovery from crashes
- ✅ **Zero Terminal Required**: Everything via buttons and web dashboard

## 📋 Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Run the on-site features installer
cd /home/pi/nfc-tap-logger
sudo bash scripts/install_onsite_features.sh
```

This installs:
- WiFi management tools (wpasupplicant, hostapd)
- mDNS service (avahi-daemon)
- Python dependencies (requests)
- Watchdog systemd service
- Configuration templates

### Configuration

1. **Add WiFi Networks**

   Edit `config/wifi_networks.conf`:
   ```
   # Format: SSID|password|priority
   Festival-Staff|secretpass123|1
   Backup-Hotspot|backup456|2
   ```

2. **Enable On-Site Features**

   Edit `config.yaml`:
   ```yaml
   onsite:
     enabled: true

     wifi:
       enabled: true

     mdns:
       enabled: true

     failover:
       enabled: true
       peer_hostname: "tapstation-exit.local"  # For QUEUE station
       # peer_hostname: "tapstation-queue.local"  # For EXIT station
   ```

3. **Restart Service**

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart tap-station
   ```

---

## 📡 WiFi Management

### Auto-Connect Flow

On boot, the system:
1. Checks WiFi configuration file
2. Scans for available networks
3. Connects to highest priority network found
4. Falls back to next priority if connection fails
5. **Enters AP mode** if no configured networks available

### WiFi Priority List

Networks are tried in priority order (lower number = higher priority):

```
SSID                 | Password      | Priority
---------------------|---------------|----------
Festival-Staff       | pass123       | 1        ← Try first
Site-Medical         | med456        | 2        ← Then this
Backup-Hotspot       | backup789     | 3        ← Finally this
```

### Adding New Networks On-Site

**Method 1: Physical Button** (Requires Manual Setup)

> **Note**: The WiFi setup button (GPIO 23) currently provides WiFi rescan functionality. 
> Full captive portal AP mode requires additional system-level configuration of hostapd 
> and dnsmasq. See the [Raspberry Pi documentation on wireless access points](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/configuration.html#setting-up-a-routed-wireless-access-point) 
> for setup instructions.

Current functionality:
1. **Short press**: Enter WiFi setup mode (prepares for config file method)
2. **Hold 3 seconds**: Force WiFi rescan to reconnect to known networks

For full captive portal functionality in a future release:
1. Press WiFi Setup button (GPIO 23)
2. Pi creates hotspot: `TapStation-<device_id>`
3. Connect to hotspot with phone (password: `tapstation123`)
4. Captive portal opens automatically
5. Select network and enter password
6. Pi saves credentials and reboots
7. Automatically connects to new network

**Method 2: Config File** (SSH Required - Recommended)

```bash
# Edit WiFi config
nano config/wifi_networks.conf

# Add new network
New-Festival-Net|password|1

# No restart needed - will connect on next scan
```

### WiFi Rescan (Force Reconnect)

**Hold WiFi Setup button for 3 seconds**
- Disables AP mode if active
- Rescans networks
- Attempts to reconnect

## 🔍 mDNS Auto-Discovery

### What is mDNS?

mDNS (Multicast DNS) lets you access stations via hostname instead of IP address.

### Access URLs

```
Queue Station:  http://tapstation-queue.local:8080
Exit Station:   http://tapstation-exit.local:8080
```

**No more hunting for IP addresses!**

### Hostname Mapping

The system automatically generates hostnames from `device_id`:

| device_id        | Hostname               |
|------------------|------------------------|
| `station1`       | `tapstation-station1`  |
| `queue-join`     | `tapstation-queue`     |
| `exit`           | `tapstation-exit`      |
| `service-start`  | `tapstation-service`   |

### Troubleshooting mDNS

**If hostname.local doesn't work:**

1. Check Avahi is running:
   ```bash
   systemctl status avahi-daemon
   ```

2. Find IP manually:
   ```bash
   hostname -I
   ```

3. Check from another device:
   ```bash
   # Linux/Mac
   avahi-browse -a

   # Or use ping
   ping tapstation-queue.local
   ```

## 🔄 Automatic Failover

### How Failover Works

**Normal Operation**
```
Station 1 (QUEUE_JOIN)  ←→  Station 2 (EXIT)
        ↓                           ↓
   Logs entries              Logs exits
```

**Failover Mode** (Station 2 fails)
```
Station 1 (DUAL MODE)
        ↓
   Logs BOTH stages
   - First tap: QUEUE_JOIN (short beep)
   - Second tap: EXIT (double beep)
```

### Failover Detection

- **Health Checks**: Every 30 seconds
- **Failure Threshold**: 2 consecutive failures (60s)
- **Automatic Recovery**: Returns to normal when peer recovers

### Failover Indicators

**LED Status**
- Yellow (both LEDs) blinking = Failover mode active

**Dashboard**
- Big banner: "⚠️ FAILOVER MODE ACTIVE"
- Shows which stages are active
- Displays peer status

**Buzzer Patterns**
- Normal mode: Short beep (success)
- Failover mode: Double beep (indicates dual operation)

### Configuration

```yaml
onsite:
  failover:
    enabled: true
    peer_hostname: "tapstation-exit.local"
    check_interval: 30          # Seconds between checks
    failure_threshold: 2        # Failures before failover
```

### Manual Failover Control

Via control panel:
- View failover status
- See peer health
- View tap counts per stage

## 🚨 Status LED Patterns

### WiFi Status

| Pattern              | Meaning                      |
|----------------------|------------------------------|
| Green solid          | Connected to WiFi            |
| Green slow blink     | Ready, no WiFi (offline OK)  |
| Green fast blink     | Connecting to WiFi           |
| Blue blink*          | WiFi setup mode (AP active)  |
| Red fast blink       | WiFi connection failed       |

*Alternates green/red if no blue LED installed

### System Status

| Pattern              | Meaning                      |
|----------------------|------------------------------|
| Alternating          | Booting up                   |
| Green solid          | Ready for taps               |
| Yellow blink         | Failover mode active         |
| Red blink            | System error                 |

### Boot Sequence

```
Power on → Alternating (booting)
       ↓
WiFi connect → Green blink (connecting)
       ↓
Connected → Green solid (ready)
```

## 🚀 On-Site Deployment Workflow

### Pre-Event Setup (Office)

1. **Configure WiFi networks**
   ```bash
   nano config/wifi_networks.conf
   ```
   Add all expected site networks

2. **Set peer hostnames**
   ```yaml
   # Station 1 (queue)
   peer_hostname: "tapstation-exit.local"

   # Station 2 (exit)
   peer_hostname: "tapstation-queue.local"
   ```

3. **Test failover**
   - Start both stations
   - Unplug one station
   - Verify other enters failover mode
   - Plug station back in
   - Verify recovery

4. **Create SD card images**
   ```bash
   # After setup, create image
   sudo dd if=/dev/mmcblk0 of=tapstation-queue.img bs=4M status=progress
   ```

### Day-of-Event Setup (On-Site)

**If WiFi pre-configured:**
1. Power on both Pis
2. Wait for green LED (30s)
3. Check dashboard via mDNS URL
4. Done!

**If new WiFi network:**
1. Power on Pi
2. Blue/alternating LED = needs WiFi
3. Press WiFi Setup button
4. Connect phone to hotspot
5. Enter site WiFi credentials
6. Pi reboots and connects
7. Green LED = ready!

### During Event

**Normal Operation**
- Green LED = all good
- Monitor dashboard as needed
- Export data periodically

**If Station Fails**
- Other station automatically enters failover
- Yellow LED indicates dual mode
- Staff tap cards twice (enter then exit)
- Continue operation with single station

**If WiFi Lost**
- Station continues offline
- Tap logging unaffected
- Dashboard unavailable until reconnect
- Press WiFi button to rescan

### Post-Event

1. Export data via control panel
2. Backup database files
3. Safe shutdown via button (hold 3s)
4. Unplug when LED turns off

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### WiFi Issues

**Can't connect to any network**
- Check WiFi config file syntax
- Verify network passwords
- Try manual WiFi setup button
- Check if networks are 2.4GHz (Pi Zero 2 doesn't support 5GHz)

**AP mode won't start**
- Check hostapd installed: `dpkg -l | grep hostapd`
- Check logs: `journalctl -u hostapd`
- Verify GPIO 23 button wiring

### mDNS Issues

**hostname.local doesn't resolve**
- Check Avahi running: `systemctl status avahi-daemon`
- Restart Avahi: `sudo systemctl restart avahi-daemon`
- Try direct IP: `hostname -I`
- Check firewall allows mDNS (port 5353 UDP)

### Failover Issues

**Failover not triggering**
- Check peer hostname correct
- Verify peer station accessible: `ping tapstation-exit.local`
- Check health endpoint: `curl http://tapstation-exit.local:8080/health`
- Review logs: `grep -i failover logs/tap-station.log`

**Stuck in failover mode**
- Check peer station actually running
- Manually restart peer station
- Check peer health via dashboard
- Failover should auto-recover within 60s

### LED Issues

**LEDs not working**
- Check GPIO connections (27=green, 22=red)
- Verify LED polarity (long leg = positive)
- Check config: `led_enabled: true`
- Test with: `python -c "from tap_station.status_leds import *; ..."`

## 🔒 Security Notes

### Network Security

- **Private networks only**: Don't expose to internet
- **Admin password**: Change default in config.yaml
- **WiFi credentials**: Stored encrypted in wpa_supplicant

### Access Control

- Control panel requires authentication
- Session timeout: 60 minutes (configurable)
- No SSH required for normal operation
- Physical access to buttons = full control
