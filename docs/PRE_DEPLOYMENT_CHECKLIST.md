## 💻 Software Verification

### Both Stations

Run these checks on **both** Station 1 and Station 2:

#### 1. Configuration Check

```bash
cd ~/nfc-tap-logger
cat config.yaml
```

**Verify:**

- [ ] `device_id` is unique (station1 vs station2)
- [ ] `stage` is correct (QUEUE_JOIN for Station 1, EXIT for Station 2)
- [ ] `session_id` matches your event (e.g., "festival-2026-summer")
- [ ] `web_server.enabled` is `true`
- [ ] `buzzer_enabled` is `true` (if using buzzer)

#### 2. Hardware Verification

```bash
cd ~/nfc-tap-logger
source venv/bin/activate
python scripts/verify_hardware.py
```

**Expected output:**

- [ ] ✓ I2C enabled
- [ ] ✓ NFC reader detected at 0x24
- [ ] ✓ Can read test card
- [ ] ✓ Buzzer works (if enabled)

#### 3. Full Deployment Verification

```bash
bash scripts/verify_deployment.sh
```

**All checks should pass:**

- [ ] ✓ System dependencies installed
- [ ] ✓ I2C interface enabled
- [ ] ✓ NFC reader detected
- [ ] ✓ Python environment configured
- [ ] ✓ Database initialized
- [ ] ✓ Service configured
- [ ] ✓ All permissions correct

#### 4. Service Status

```bash
sudo systemctl status tap-station
```

**Verify:**

- [ ] Service is enabled
- [ ] Service is running (or start it)
- [ ] No errors in status output

#### 5. Test Card Tap

```bash
# Watch logs
tail -f logs/tap-station.log
```

Then tap a test card:

- [ ] Hear beep (if buzzer enabled)
- [ ] See log entry with token ID and UID
- [ ] Tap same card again - should get double-beep (duplicate)

#### 6. Web Dashboard Access

Find your Pi's IP address:

```bash
hostname -I
```

From phone/laptop, visit:

- [ ] `http://<pi-ip>:8080/health` - Returns JSON with status
- [ ] `http://<pi-ip>:8080/dashboard` - Shows live dashboard
- [ ] `http://<pi-ip>:8080/monitor` - Shows simplified monitor
- [ ] `http://<pi-ip>:8080/control` - Shows control panel

#### 7. Database Check

```bash
sqlite3 data/events.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM events WHERE session_id='your-session-id'"
```

- [ ] Returns 0 if fresh start (or expected count if testing)
- [ ] Database file exists and is accessible

---

## 📱 Mobile/Monitoring Setup

---

## 🧪 End-to-End Test

**Do a full simulation before the event!**

1. **Station 1 (Queue Entry)**
   - [ ] Tap test card #1
   - [ ] Hear beep
   - [ ] See event in dashboard
   - [ ] Tap same card again - get duplicate beep
   - [ ] Tap different test card #2
   - [ ] See both in queue on dashboard

2. **Station 2 (Exit)**
   - [ ] Tap test card #1
   - [ ] Hear beep
   - [ ] See completion in dashboard
   - [ ] Check "Recent Completions" shows wait time
   - [ ] Tap test card #2
   - [ ] Verify both completed

3. **Dashboard Verification**
   - [ ] "In Queue" count is correct (0 after both exited)
   - [ ] "Completed Today" shows 2
   - [ ] Recent completions show both cards with wait times
   - [ ] Activity chart shows entries
   - [ ] Live event feed shows all taps

4. **Data Export Test**

   ```bash
   python scripts/export_data.py
   ```

   - [ ] CSV file created
   - [ ] Contains all test events
   - [ ] Timestamps correct
   - [ ] Token IDs and stages correct

5. **Clean Up Test Data**

   ```bash
   # Option 1: Delete test session from database
   sqlite3 data/events.db "DELETE FROM events WHERE session_id='your-test-session'"

   # Option 2: Start fresh with new session_id in config.yaml
   nano config.yaml  # Change session_id to event name
   sudo systemctl restart tap-station
   ```
