## Quick Reference Card

### Your Job: Help People Tap

1. Hand participant a card: _"Tap this at each station to track wait times"_
2. Point to tap zone (where NFC reader is)
3. Wait for beep
4. Done!

### Beep Codes

| Sound                        | Meaning                | What to Say               |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------- |
| 🔊 **BEEP** (1 short)        | ✅ Success             | "You're all set!"         |
| 🔊🔊 **BEEP-BEEP** (2 short) | ⚠️ Already tapped here | "Already checked in!"     |
| 🔊━━━ **BEEEEEP** (1 long)   | ❌ Error               | "Try again, hold it flat" |

### If Something Goes Wrong

1. Ask them to try again (hold flat for 2 seconds)
2. Try a different card
3. Write it down manually (name or number)
4. Find the tech person if it keeps happening

## During Event: Peer Workflow

### Station 1 (Queue Entry): Registration Desk

**When someone arrives for service:**

1. **Greet and hand card**
   - "Welcome! Here's a card - tap it at each station"
   - "It helps us track wait times"

2. **Guide them to tap**
   - "Hold it flat on this reader for a second"
   - Point to tap zone

3. **Wait for beep**
   - 1 beep = ✅ Success: "You're all set!"
   - 2 beeps = ⚠️ Duplicate: "Already checked in - you're good!"
   - Long beep = ❌ Error: "Try again, hold it flat"

4. **If tap fails after 2-3 attempts**
   - Try different card
   - Write name/number on backup sheet
   - Keep going (don't hold up the queue)

5. **Direct to service**
   - "Head inside for your service"
   - "Tap your card again when you exit"

### Station 2 (Exit): After Service

**When someone exits service:**

1. **Remind them to tap**
   - "Don't forget to tap out!"
   - Point to reader

2. **Wait for beep**
   - Same beep codes as Station 1

3. **Thank them**
   - "Thanks! Have a great festival!"
   - They can keep or return the card

### Managing Cards

**Handing out cards:**

- Keep stack accessible at Station 1
- Hand one card per person
- No need to track which person gets which card

**Collecting cards (optional):**

- Set up collection box at Station 2
- "You can keep it or return it here"
- Cards can be reused at future events

**Running low on cards:**

- Collect cards from return box
- Cards can be tapped multiple times (different sessions)
- Have backup manual log if cards run out

## Monitoring During Event

### Live Dashboard (Recommended)

Access dashboards on any phone, tablet, or laptop connected to the same network:

```
# Full analytics dashboard (for coordinators)
http://<pi-ip-address>:8080/dashboard

# Simplified monitor (for peer workers)
http://<pi-ip-address>:8080/monitor

# Control panel (for administrators)
http://<pi-ip-address>:8080/control
```

**Find your Pi's IP:** Run `hostname -I` on the Pi

**Security Note:** The control panel provides administrative access. In production:

- Keep the Pi on a private network
- Use firewall rules to restrict access
- Only share control panel URL with trusted administrators

```
# On phone/laptop connected to same network
http://<pi-ip-address>:8080/health
```

Shows:

- Station ID
- Stage
- Total taps logged
- Status: OK or Error

### Making Operational Decisions

#### Scenario: Queue Length Growing

**Dashboard shows:** In Queue = 12 (🟡 Warning)

**Actions:**

1. ✅ Check avg wait time - is service slowing down?
2. ✅ Review recent completions - are people exiting normally?
3. ✅ Consider: Do we need another peer worker?
4. ✅ Communicate wait times to new arrivals
5. ✅ Monitor for next 15 minutes

#### Scenario: Wait Times Elevated

**Dashboard shows:** Longest Wait = 50min (🟠), Avg Wait = 35min

**Actions:**

1. ✅ Check capacity utilization - are we operating efficiently?
2. ✅ Review service process - any bottlenecks?
3. ✅ Find the person who's been waiting longest (check Queue Status)
4. ✅ Consider priority service for longest waiters
5. ✅ Communicate realistic wait times to new arrivals

#### Scenario: Critical Queue

**Dashboard shows:** In Queue = 23 (🔴 Critical), Est. Wait = 65min

**Actions:**

1. 🚨 **Immediate:** Check both stations functioning
2. 🚨 Call for additional volunteers/resources
3. 🚨 Communicate honestly: "Wait time currently ~1 hour"
4. 🚨 Consider: Can service be expedited without compromising safety?
5. 🚨 May need to temporarily stop accepting new entries
6. 🚨 Prioritize people who've been waiting longest

#### Scenario: Low Activity

**Dashboard shows:** In Queue = 0-2, Throughput dropping

**Actions:**

1. ✅ Good time for peer worker breaks
2. ✅ Restock supplies
3. ✅ Check equipment (while not busy)
4. ✅ Prepare for next rush (monitor activity chart for patterns)

#### Scenario: System Issues

**Dashboard shows:** No new events for 10+ minutes (but people are around)

**Actions:**

1. ⚠️ Check both stations visually
2. ⚠️ Test tap a card at each station
3. ⚠️ Check power banks (lights still on?)
4. ⚠️ If one station down: redistribute workflow
5. ⚠️ If both down: Switch to manual logging immediately
6. ⚠️ Don't troubleshoot during event - document for later

### Dashboard Best Practices

**🔄 Refresh Rate:** Dashboard auto-refreshes every 5 seconds

**📱 Access:** Anyone can view, use tablet/phone mounted in visible location

**👥 Who Should Monitor:**

- Lead coordinator: Watch full dashboard
- Peer workers: Don't need constant monitoring, check periodically
- Tech support: Monitor for system health issues

**⏰ Check Frequency:**

- 🟢 Quiet times: Every 15-20 minutes
- 🟡 Moderate: Every 10 minutes
- 🟠 Busy: Every 5 minutes or keep visible
- 🔴 Critical: Continuous monitoring

**📊 Key Indicators for Quick Glance:**

1. **Queue card color:**
   - Green = All good
   - Yellow/Orange = Pay attention
   - Red = Take action
2. **Alerts section:** Any red alerts = immediate attention
3. **Activity chart:** Trending up or down?

### Communicating With Participants

Use dashboard data to set expectations:

**At Entry (Station 1):**

- "Current wait time is approximately [EST. WAIT] minutes"
- "We're serving about [THROUGHPUT] people per hour"
- If queue is long: "Queue is longer than usual, estimated [EST. WAIT] min wait"

**During Wait:**

- If someone asks: Check their position in Queue Status
- "You're #[POSITION] in queue, should be another [ESTIMATE] minutes"

**Managing Expectations:**

- ✅ Be honest about wait times
- ✅ Under-promise, over-deliver
- ✅ Update if situation changes
- ❌ Don't guarantee specific times
- ❌ Don't blame technology

### Control Panel (Administrators Only)

The control panel (`/control`) provides a web-based interface for all system management tasks. **This is for tech leads and administrators only.**

**📘 For complete control panel reference**, see [Control Panel Documentation](CONTROL_PANEL.md)

#### What It Provides

**System Status:**

- Real-time service status (running/stopped)
- Total events logged
- System uptime
- Database size

**Service Management:**

- Start/stop/restart the tap-station service
- View detailed service status and logs
- No SSH required for basic operations

**Diagnostics & Verification:**

- **Verify Hardware** - Test NFC reader connection
- **Verify Deployment** - Run full system checks
- **Health Check** - Check system health
- **I2C Devices** - Scan for connected I2C devices

**Data Operations:**

- **Export Data** - Export events to CSV
- **Backup Database** - Create timestamped backup
- **View Recent Events** - See last 20 events
- **Database Stats** - View statistics

**System Control (Use with Caution!):**

- **Reboot System** - Restart the Raspberry Pi
- **Shutdown System** - Power off (requires physical restart)
- **View Logs** - Show recent system logs
- **Disk Usage** - Check storage space

**Development Tools:**

- **Dev Reset** - Reset I2C and NFC reader
- **Test Card Read** - Test reading an NFC card
- **Run Tests** - Execute test suite
- **Git Status** - Check repository status

#### When to Use Control Panel

**Pre-Event:**

- Verify hardware before deployment
- Run full system checks
- Test card reading

**During Event:**

- Monitor service status
- Restart service if issues occur
- View recent events to verify logging
- Export data for interim analysis

**Post-Event:**

- Export final data
- Create database backup
- View logs for troubleshooting
- Shutdown system safely

#### Best Practices

✅ **Do:**

- Bookmark control panel URL for quick access
- Test commands in pre-event setup
- Export data regularly
- Use during downtime, not during active service

❌ **Don't:**

- Restart system during active service hours
- Share control panel URL with untrained volunteers
- Shutdown system without ensuring data is saved
- Make changes during critical queue situations

**If Something Goes Wrong:**

- Use control panel to view logs
- Check service status
- Restart service if needed
- Fall back to manual logging if issues persist

### Power Management

**Power bank indicators:**

- 4 LEDs = 75-100% (good for full event)
- 3 LEDs = 50-75% (still good)
- 2 LEDs = 25-50% (consider swapping)
- 1 LED = <25% (swap power bank)

**Swapping power bank:**

1. Have replacement ready
2. Plug in new power bank first
3. Quickly disconnect old one
4. Pi should stay running (brief power dip OK)
5. Or let it reboot (takes 30 seconds)

## Common Situations

### "Did my tap work?"

**How to tell:**

- You heard a beep = YES
- No beep = NO, try again

**If unsure:**

- Have them tap again
- Duplicate tap = 2 beeps = confirms first tap worked

### "I lost my card"

**No problem:**

- Give them a new card
- System tracks by card UID, not person
- Multiple taps are fine for statistics

### "Can I use my phone?"

**Current answer:**

- Not for logging taps (Raspberry Pi version requires NFC cards)
- Maybe yes if mobile app version is deployed (see [Mobile Guide](MOBILE.md))

**If NFC Tools integration enabled:**

- They can tap phone to card to check status
- But still need to tap card at station

### "The station isn't beeping"

**Quick fixes:**

1. Check power bank is on and charged
2. Check USB cable is plugged in
3. Wait 30 seconds (may be booting)
4. Try tapping a card you know works
5. If still fails, switch to manual logging

**Don't:**

- Try to restart or troubleshoot during event
- Delay participants
- Panic - manual logging works fine

### "Someone tapped the wrong station"

**No problem:**

- System logs all taps
- Can be filtered during analysis
- Not a critical error

### "Cards aren't working"

**Possible causes:**

- Cards not initialized (should be done before event)
- Wrong type of cards (need NTAG215)
- Reader malfunction

**Solution:**

- Switch to manual logging
- Record: time, approximate participant ID
- Continue event, troubleshoot later

---

## Manual Backup Logging

If technology fails, use paper:

**Log sheet template:**

```
Event: _______________  Station: ___  Date: ________

Time    | Participant ID / Description | Stage
--------|------------------------------|-------------
2:15pm  | Blue shirt, ~30yo            | QUEUE_JOIN
2:17pm  | Green hat, "Alex"            | QUEUE_JOIN
2:32pm  | Blue shirt                   | EXIT
```

**Tips:**

- Note distinctive features or names
- Record times (even approximate)
- Don't delay participants for logging
- Can be entered into system later

---

## End of Event (15 minutes)

### Station Shutdown

**Don't immediately power off!** Give system time to finish writes.

1. **Stop accepting new taps**
   - Remove "TAP HERE" signs
   - Collect remaining cards

2. **Wait 2-3 minutes**
   - Let any pending writes complete

3. **Graceful shutdown**

   ```bash
   ssh pi@<station-ip>
   sudo systemctl stop tap-station
   sudo shutdown -h now
   ```

   **Or:** Just unplug power (system is crash-resistant)

4. **Pack hardware**
   - Disconnect NFC reader
   - Store in protective case
   - Note any damage or issues

### Data Export

**On-site quick export:**

```bash
ssh pi@<station-ip>
cd ~/nfc-tap-logger
source venv/bin/activate
python scripts/export_data.py
```

Creates `export_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.csv` in current directory.

**Retrieve via:**

- SCP: `scp pi@<station-ip>:~/nfc-tap-logger/export_*.csv .`
- USB drive: Copy file to mounted drive
- Email: Use `mail` command if configured

**Or:** Remove SD card and read directly on laptop

### Post-Event Checklist

- [ ] Data exported from both stations
- [ ] Hardware packed safely
- [ ] Damage/issues noted
- [ ] Cards collected (if reusing)
- [ ] Power banks plugged in to recharge
- [ ] Backup logs collected (if any)
- [ ] Feedback from peer workers noted

## Tips for Success

### For Peer Workers

- **Keep it simple:** "Tap card, wait for beep, you're done"
- **Don't over-explain:** People don't need to know how it works
- **Stay positive:** If tech fails, manual logging works fine
- **Don't troubleshoot:** Focus on participant experience, flag tech issues for later

### For Tech Support

- **Test early:** Boot stations 30 min before event start
- **Have spares:** Extra cards, power banks, cables
- **Stay available:** Check stations hourly
- **Document issues:** Note problems for post-event review
- **Prioritize people:** If tech is blocking participants, switch to manual

### For Smooth Operation

- **Position matters:** Reader should be at comfortable height, well-lit
- **Signs help:** Clear "TAP HERE" visual indicator
- **Card management:** Keep cards organized and accessible
- **Backup plan:** Always have manual log sheets ready
- **Test workflow:** Do a full rehearsal before event

---

## FAQ

**Q: What if someone taps multiple times?**
A: System deduplicates within same stage. Multiple taps = one log entry.

**Q: Can cards be reused at different events?**
A: Yes! Just change the `session_id` in config.

**Q: What if they forget to tap at exit?**
A: Shows as "abandoned queue" - valuable data about flow.

**Q: How do we analyze the data later?**
A: Export CSV and use spreadsheet or provided analysis scripts.

**Q: Can we see live statistics during event?**
A: Yes, if web server enabled: `http://<pi-ip>:8080` shows stats.

**Q: What if it rains?**
A: Use weatherproof cases or ziplock bags with opening for reader.

**Q: Do we need WiFi?**
A: No! System works completely offline.

**Q: Can we use this for other workflows?**
A: Yes! System supports custom stages - configure as needed.
