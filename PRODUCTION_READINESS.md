## 🔧 Known Limitations & Mitigations

### Limitations

1. **Network Required for Dashboards** - Stations log offline, but dashboards need network
   - **Mitigation:** Stations work fully offline; dashboards are optional bonus
2. **Manual Card Distribution** - System doesn't assign cards to specific people
   - **Mitigation:** By design; anonymous tracking protects privacy
3. **Physical Hardware Dependency** - Requires working NFC readers
   - **Mitigation:** Manual paper logging as backup; dev reset tools for recovery
4. **No Built-in Authentication** - Control panel accessible to anyone on network
   - **Mitigation:** Private network, firewall rules; future enhancement available
5. **Limited to NTAG215 Cards** - Won't work with other card types
   - **Mitigation:** NTAG215 is cheap ($0.25/card) and widely available

### Edge Cases Handled

- [x] Power loss during database write (WAL mode)
- [x] I2C bus hanging (dev reset tool)
- [x] Duplicate card taps (debounce + detection)
- [x] Service crashes (automatic restart)
- [x] Network unavailable (offline operation)
- [x] Cards run out (manual logging backup)
- [x] NFC reader fails (fall back to manual)
