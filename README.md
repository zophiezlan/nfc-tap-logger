# FlowState

**A simple, reliable system for tracking wait times at festival harm reduction services using NFC tap stations.**

Two tap stations measure queue flow: participants tap their NFC card when joining the queue and again when exiting. The system logs timestamps to calculate wait times, throughput, and service metrics.

**Designed for:** Festival peer workers who need a dead-simple, network-free system that runs all day on battery power.

## Why This Exists

Drug checking services at festivals need data to optimize flow, measure impact, and report to funders—but currently rely on manual estimates. This system provides accurate metrics with minimal technical burden on peer workers operating in chaotic, outdoor environments.

**Key metrics:**

- Median & 90th percentile wait times
- Hourly throughput
- Abandonment rate (joined but didn't complete)

## Live Monitoring

The system includes powerful real-time dashboards for operational management during your event.

### Access Dashboards

Once the system is running, access dashboards from any device on the same network:

```
# Full analytics dashboard (for coordinators)
http://<pi-ip-address>:8080/dashboard

# Simplified monitor (for peer workers)
http://<pi-ip-address>:8080/monitor

# Control panel (for administrators)
http://<pi-ip-address>:8080/control
```

**Find your Pi's IP address:**

```bash
hostname -I
```

**Security Note:** The control panel provides system administration capabilities. Keep your Pi on a private network and only share the control panel URL with trusted administrators.

### Dashboard Features

#### 📊 Full Dashboard (`/dashboard`)

**For coordinators and decision-makers**

- **Real-time metrics:**
  - People in queue right now
  - Estimated wait time for new arrivals
  - Longest current wait (time in service)
  - Capacity utilization
  - Throughput per hour

- **Operational alerts:**
  - 🟢 Green: All systems normal
  - 🟡 Yellow: Queue getting busy (>10 people or >45min wait)
  - 🔴 Red: Critical conditions (>20 people or >90min wait)

- **Queue details:**
  - Position in queue (#1, #2, etc.)
  - Time each person has been waiting
  - Real-time updates every 5 seconds

- **Activity visualization:**
  - 12-hour activity chart
  - Recent completions with wait times
  - Live event feed showing all taps

#### 📱 Simplified Monitor (`/monitor`)

**For peer workers and quick status checks**

- Large, easy-to-read display optimized for mobile/tablet
- Critical metrics only:
  - People waiting
  - Estimated wait time
  - Simple status indicators
- Color-coded alerts (green/yellow/red)
- No clutter - just what you need to know

### Using Live Data Operationally

**At Queue Entry:**

- Communicate current wait time to arrivals
- Adjust staffing based on queue length alerts

**During Service:**

- Monitor longest wait to prioritize people
- Track throughput to identify bottlenecks
- Use alerts to make staffing decisions

**Example scenarios:**

```
🟢 Queue: 3 people, Est. wait: 15min
→ All good, normal operations

🟡 Queue: 12 people, Est. wait: 35min, Longest wait: 47min
→ Monitor closely, consider calling extra volunteer

🔴 Queue: 24 people, Est. wait: 65min, Longest wait: 95min
→ URGENT: Add resources, prioritize longest waiters
```

See the [Operations Guide](docs/OPERATIONS.md) for detailed guidance on interpreting metrics and making operational decisions.

### Control Panel (`/control`)

**Administrative interface for system management** - No SSH required!

**Authentication Required:** The control panel now requires password authentication to protect administrative functions.

**First Time Setup:**

1. Set your admin password in `config.yaml`:

   ```yaml
   web_server:
     admin:
       password: "your-secure-password-here"
   ```

2. All staff members can use this password to access admin functions during shift

Execute common tasks through a web interface:

- **Service Management:** Start/stop/restart tap-station service
- **Diagnostics:** Verify hardware, run health checks, scan I2C devices
- **Data Operations:** Export data, backup database, view recent events
- **System Control:** Reboot, shutdown, view logs, check disk space
- **Development:** Reset I2C, test card reading, run tests

**Key Benefits:**

- Execute commands without SSH access
- Real-time command output display
- Safety confirmations for destructive operations
- Quick troubleshooting during events
- One-click data export and backup
- All staff members can be admins via UI

**Security:**

- Password-protected admin access
- Session-based authentication with timeout
- Keep your Pi on a private network
- Share admin password only with trusted staff

## Configuration

### Station Configuration

Each Pi needs unique `device_id` and appropriate `stage`:

**Station 1 (Queue Join):**

```yaml
station:
  device_id: "station1"
  stage: "QUEUE_JOIN"
  session_id: "festival-2025-summer"
````

**Station 2 (Exit):**

```yaml
station:
  device_id: "station2"
  stage: "EXIT"
  session_id: "festival-2025-summer"
```

### GPIO Configuration

Customize GPIO pins in `config.yaml`:

```yaml
feedback:
  buzzer_enabled: true
  led_enabled: true
  gpio:
    buzzer: 17
    led_green: 27
    led_red: 22
```

### Beep Patterns

Customize beep patterns (on/off times in seconds):

```yaml
feedback:
  beep_success: [0.1] # Short beep
  beep_duplicate: [0.1, 0.05, 0.1] # Double beep
  beep_error: [0.3] # Long beep
```

## Testing

Run tests without hardware:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
pytest tests/ -v
```

Tests use mock NFC reader, so they work on any machine.

## Common Issues

**See the [Troubleshooting Guide](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md) for comprehensive problem-solving.**

Quick fixes:

**I2C not working:**

```bash
bash scripts/enable_i2c.sh
sudo reboot
```

**PN532 not detected:**

```bash
sudo i2cdetect -y 1  # Should show device at 0x24
